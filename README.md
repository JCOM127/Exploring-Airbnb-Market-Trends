Airbnb Listings Data Analysis
This project focuses on the analysis of Airbnb listings data, employing Python programming along with Pandas and Matplotlib libraries to merge, explore, and visualize datasets related to Airbnb listings.

Overview
The project comprises three main datasets:

airbnb_price.csv: Contains pricing information for Airbnb listings.
airbnb_room_type.xlsx: Provides data on the types of rooms in each listing.
airbnb_last_review.tsv: Offers details about the last review for each listing.
The datasets are initially read into separate DataFrames and then merged based on the common column, "listing_id," using Pandas' merge() function.

Analysis and Tasks
Data Merging: Combine the datasets into a unified DataFrame, enabling comprehensive analysis and insights.
Data Cleansing: Convert data types to appropriate formats (e.g., dates to datetime objects) and extract essential information (e.g., price value from strings).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct statistical analyses, such as calculating averages, identifying distributions, and exploring room types, prices, and review dates.
Data Visualization: Utilize Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations, including histograms, bar plots, and other relevant visual representations for insights.
